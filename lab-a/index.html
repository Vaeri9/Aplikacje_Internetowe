        <h3>Lusia is my cat and I love her.</h3>
        <p>She does not eat anything besides cat food, which is a blessing.</p>
        <h2>Her favorite pastime is meowing for attention.</h2>
        <h3>Once my dad accidentally closed her in his wardrobe (she likes to inspect the clothes).</h3>
        <p>I may have forgotten about her on the balcony on Monday (she doesn't go out into the world but she does enjoy being a surveillance camera). She's not mad about that and still loves me.</p>
        <h2>Unfortunately she's not fond of being held in hands or on the lap for too long.</h2>
        <h3>Nor does she like sleeping with others.</h3>
        <p>She's getting banished from my room every night as she licks people awake when she deems it breakfast time.</p>
        <h2>The pictures don't convey how gigantic of a cat she is.</h2>
        <h3>Lusia's favorite toys are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tin foil balls</li>
          <li>Worm on a string</li>
          <li>My drying laundry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Her fur is everywhere. On my clothes. In every corner. In my food, even.</p>
        <h3>She gets easily scared of any and every thing.</h3>
        <p>Once she managed to knock down her cattree. Chaos inducer.</p>
